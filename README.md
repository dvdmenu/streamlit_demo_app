# streamlit_demo_app
This app is created for two goals: Firstly, I wanted a simple feature engineering project. Secondly, I wanted to explore possibilities of making interactive dashboards directly from Python environment.
For the first goal, I chose a domain that I knew nothing about before the project: Inflation Adjustment. You can find out how I did it from the resulting web app: https://data-science-demo.streamlit.app/

For the second goal, I chose Streamlit for its simplicity and capability to output crisp visualizations in the same manner one would execute them in Jupyter Notebook Environment with your regular visualization tools such as Seaborn.
